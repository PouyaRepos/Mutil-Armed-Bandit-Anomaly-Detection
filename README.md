The concept of Multi-Armed Bandit and anomaly detection has been studied by many scientists. In this project, I tried to review one of the related papers, where these two methods has been combined and the authors provided their outlier definition. For more details please refer to the [pdf](https://github.com/PouyaRepos/Mutil-Armed-Bandit-Anomaly-Detection/blob/main/MAB_anomaly_detection.pdf)  containing following outlines:
1. Introduction
	- Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
	- Anomaly detection
	- Clustering 
	
2. Outiler detection in MAB
	- Problem definition
	- Scope and limitations of the definition
	- Pulling algorithm
	- Expreminetal observation of Algorithm 1
3. Conclusion
